I am hands on and willing to get the job done. I started a course in Web Development last year and became very passionate in this field. I am quite the creative individual. Problems don't exist for me only challenges. A friend recently said the following about me "you don't sleep when you're tired, you sleep when the work is done!" This about sums up my dedication when I am focussed on a project.</p></div>
